## Projects

[**Estimating Galaxy Masses from 3D Survey Data**](https://github.com/sjl-03/sjl-03.github.io/raw/main/Estimating_Galaxy_Masses_from_3D_Galaxy_Survey_Data%20(4)%5B4467%5D.pdf)
_King’s College London Certificate, Distinction_

A collaborative research-based project where we established and tuned the prediction model of galaxy mass through machine learning algorithms over Python, evaluated the model's accuracy, and compared it with the SDSS data.

- Tested and tuned machine learning models (linear regression, random forest).
- Optimized the model by applying different filters to training data.
- Produced visual presentations and explained the project at a Sixth Form event.
